# BanorteAI
Our team participated in the 2023 HACKATON, the largest hackathon in Latin America, hosted by Tec de Monterrey. We developed a web application for Banorte designed to assist customers facing financial challenges. Notably, I learned to use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS within a 24-hour timeframe during this project. Initially, we explored implementing machine learning to enhance the AI's ability to provide accurate responses to customer inquiries. However, due to budget constraints, we ultimately integrated ChatGPT-3 to facilitate customer interactions.

While our original vision involved using machine learning to optimize the AI's performance, we had to disable this feature due to limited resources. Nevertheless, our web application, powered by ChatGPT-3, aims to provide valuable support to customers seeking financial guidance and solutions.

(Currently, the AI functionality of the HTML is not operational because we exhausted the funds for the API key.)
